# 👋 Hi, I’m Prathamesh Kulkarni

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science with a strong foundation in software development and hands-on experience in data engineering. I recently worked as a Data Engineer at a workplace analytics SaaS startup, where I built scalable ETL pipelines using Python, Airflow, and SQL, and deployed data workflows on Google Cloud Platform.

My interests lie at the intersection of data infrastructure, analytics, and scalable backend systems. I enjoy working with tools like Neo4j, MLflow, and Docker, and I'm always exploring ways to apply clean engineering practices to solve complex data problems.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* Languages: Python, TypeScript, SQL

* Data Tools: Airflow, Neo4j, MLflow, DVC

* Cloud: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS (learning)

* Other: Docker, FastAPI, React, Next.js

## 🔍 Currently Exploring

Scalable data platforms and analytics pipelines

Cloud-native infrastructure with Kubernetes

Applied machine learning for time-series and behavior insights
